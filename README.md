## Experience

A detailed overview of my experience up to and including October 10, 2025 is available upon request. I have progressed from a technical support specialist to a QA tester and then to a full-stack web developer; I have also worked on editorial content and, for a period, served as a project manager for a team of copywriters. I found my professional path in game design because it allows me to combine two disciplines: STEM and the humanities.
