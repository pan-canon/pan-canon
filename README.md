Dear team,

Over the years, I have moved along a deliberately technical trajectory: from a frontline technical support specialist working directly with end users and real-world edge cases, through QA testing with a focus on reproducibility and systemic thinking, to a full-stack web developer responsible for designing and implementing production-ready solutions. Parallel to this, I have worked with editorial content and for a period coordinated a team of copywriters as a project manager, combining process discipline with an eye for tone, style, and audience.

As a result, I have come to see my work as sitting at the intersection of systems engineering and storytelling. I found my professional path in game design precisely because it allows me to integrate two domains that have always defined my interests: the formal rigor of STEM (systems, mechanics, constraints) and the interpretive depth of the humanities (narrative, theme, character, worldbuilding).

## Technology Stack

**Programming Languages:**   
JavaScript (ES6+), PHP, SQL (incl. D1), HTML5, CSS3, Bash, PowerShell

**Preprocessors and Extensions (as needed):**   
TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript), CSS preprocessors (Sass, Less, PostCSS).

**Tools and VCS:**
- Webpack (bundler)
- Composer (PHP package manager)
- WP CLI (WordPress Command Line Interface)
- Git (VCS)

**CMS, Frameworks and SSG:**
- WordPress (commercial experience: development of Classic/FSE themes and plugins)
- Laravel (commercial experience)
- Angular, Vue.js (self-study, pet projects)
- Hugo (pet projects)
- SaaS platforms (internal testing, technical support, and custom solutions | commercial experience)

**Libraries:**   
React, jQuery (jQ within WordPress)

**Server Infrastructure and Network Configuration:**
- Deployment and administration on Unix-like OS (Linux, BSD)
- Network settings configuration (TCP/IP, firewall)

**Containerization and Virtualization:**   
Docker, VirtualBox, Hyper-V

**Design and Multimedia:**
- Adobe Photoshop (Clone Stamp tool)
- Figma (UI/UX design)
- Preparing mockups for merchandise printing (choosing formats, color profiles)
- Video editing (FFmpeg, Adobe Premiere, Canva)

**SEO (basic level):**
- Google Analytics setup
- Proper use of hreflang for multilingual site versions
- Meta-data optimization, sitemap.xml

**Methodologies and Practices:**
- Low-level code design: SOLID, DRY, KISS, dependency injection, separation of concerns
- High-level application architecture: client–server, layered architecture, MVC/MVVM for web front ends, modular monoliths, microservices (where justified)
- Advanced architecture and system design: Hexagonal architecture (Ports & Adapters — my preferred approach for complex, testable systems), Domain-Driven Design (bounded contexts, aggregates), event-driven patterns (message queues, pub/sub) when needed
- DevOps (CI/CD, build and deployment automation)
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming: JavaScript, PHP)
- BEM (BEM methodology for scalable CSS architecture)

## Portfolio

- Explore my work with game teams at [@Zhovten Games](https://github.com/Zhovten-Games), designing and shipping narrative-driven game systems — core loops, progression, and story structures that work in real production, not just on paper.

## In My Free Time

- I spend quality time with my family—teaching my son (see [kinder.github.io](https://github.com/PhantomDraft/kinder.github.io)) and sharing our love of games.
