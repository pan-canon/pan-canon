## Experience

I began my career in 2011 as a Technical Support Specialist at uCoz, resolving user requests and automating solutions. In 2017, I transitioned to content project management at Scuba Space, where I built and trained a distributed writing team. From 2018 to 2019, I led merchandising and CMS integrations for Carlsberg Group. In late 2019, I joined ZIPY Holdings Ltd as a Full-Stack Web Engineer, architecting a custom WooCommerce subscription platform. Since 2021, I’ve been freelancing—delivering responsive web solutions, writing in-depth technical articles, and advising on horror-themed game narratives.
